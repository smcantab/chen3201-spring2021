Very few problems in chemical engineering have analytical solutions. In the course of learning the engineering science at the heart of chemical engineering, you have probably focused on this small subset of solvable problems. In this class, you will learn how to construct numerical approximations to the solutions of the rest of the problems. The course is organized around the following themes: Intro to mathematical modeling and programming in Matlab Linear algebraic equations Nonlinear algebraic equations Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs): Initial Value Problems and Boundary Value Problems Dynamical Systems Theory Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) Numerical Integration.

Piazza Please use Piazza ( sign-up link ) for anything technical question e.g. homework, or anything else that applies broadly to the class. I encourage you to post your questions on Piazza and to try answering your classmates' questions. You can do so anonymously if you do not feel comfortable asking or answering a question publicly. Homework There will be 12 assignments (written and/or code). Assignments will be posted by the end of Friday and are due by the end of Friday (23:59) of the following week. Submit homework through Gradescope accessible via the Canvas course page . For exercises involving coding I will create a corresponding code assignments. You must paste your code in the appropriate coding assignment on Gradescope . Note that Gradescope provides a code similarity check so that we can easily spot plagiarism in your code. The worst grade does not count (see scholastic dishonesty for exceptions), but you cannot skip any assignments (if you do it counts). You can be late by 2 days once , for whatever reason. Any time after that, late work will not be accepted (score of 0). There can be additional accommodations in the case of properly documented family emergencies or illness. I encourage you to collaborate on homework, but please do so through Piazza to the extent that is possible. Nevertheless, you must come up with your own solutions and write your own code. So, when answering questions on Piazza guide your classmates towards the solution, do not post fully worked solutions. Each homework problem will be graded on a 3 point scale with the following breakdown: 3 pts : Correct, complete and easy to follow the code/solution 2 pts : Minor error, minor omission or difficult to follow the code/solution 1 pt : Major error, major omission or very poorly written code/solution 0 pts : Not submitted or lack of effort (at the grader\u2018s discretion) Some problems may be worth double credit due to their complexity or parts. In addition to the \u201ccorrectness\u201d score, you will also receive a \u201ccompleteness\u201d score. You will get a completeness score of 0 if you get a 0 on the problem. Otherwise you will receive a 1. The solution to all of the problems on the homework will be posted on Canvas shortly after the \"late\" due date. In addition to the graded problems, we will post an extensive set of practice problems and old exam problems that will familiarize you with the algorithms underlying numerical methods and basic mathematical skills. The examinations will be similar to these homework questions, so you should work them out on your own to prepare for the exams. Examinations There will be two in-class midterm examinations following the course schedule, see Calendar for dates. The final exam will be two hours and comprehensive. We will distribute a sheet of relevant equations that you may need together with each exam. We will email the equations sheet to you at least 2 days before the examination. Although the exams will happen remotely, communicating devices (cell phones, etc.), chatting and web browsing are not permitted during the examination. No student will be permitted to take the exam before the scheduled time and no makeup exams will be given. Students who miss an exam will be given a grade of zero for it unless personal illness or family emergency was the reason for missing the exam. Special arrangements will be made in such circumstances, provided that they are well documented. Regrading Students who wish to have their homework or exams re-graded must submit their request via Gradescope within 1 week of the homework being returned. You will not be able to request a re-grade after the deadline has passed. The entire exam/hw will be reviewed for any other possible oversights, and a revised grade (which may be higher or lower) will be returned to the student. Grading Policy Your grade will be based on these components: Homework : 30% Midterm 1 : 20% Midterm 2 : 20% Final Exam : 30% Please ignore the score for your total grade on Canvas, as it does not reflect the weighting of different parts of the course. University grading scales Grade GPA Definitions for undergraduate credit A 4.000 Represents achievement that significantly exceeds expectations in the course. B 3.000 Represents achievement that is above the minimum expectations in the course. C 2.000 Represents achievement that meets the minimum expectations in the course. D 1.000 Achievement partially meets minimum expectations. Credit is earned but may not fulfill major requirements. F 0.000 Represents failure in the course and no credit is earned. Scholastic dishonesty Departmental policy We understand the pressures students face during the academic semester can be intense, and that the temptation to engage in academic dishonesty can at times be high. However, the department is committed to the highest standards of academic honesty and integrity. To help ensure that our community standards are met, reviews of student academic integrity will take place throughout the semester. If academic dishonesty is uncovered, the following sanctions will be applied. Examples of these reviews involve cross-comparison of student work against other student work, work from prior semesters, or resources available online. If necessary, reviews of student work may continue after the submission of final course grades, and application or removal of sanctions may be imposed retroactively. Situations were students are found by a preponderance of the evidence to have engaged in academic dishonesty based on the reviews of student work by the course instructor on at least one examination in a course in the chemical engineering program will be addressed by the following program policy: The instructor will seek to arrange an in-person or virtual meeting with the student to present them with the evidence of the academic dishonesty. The student will have the opportunity to respond, in accordance with the policy from the Office of Community Standards (OCS). If following this discussion, the instructor determines that academic dishonesty has not occurred, there will be no report to OCS and no sanctions. Otherwise, the case will be referred to OCS with the following sanctions in the course: If the academic dishonesty is confined to a single examination and the student has admitted fault, the student may be given the option to take an oral examination or closely proctored written examination to demonstrate their understanding of the material on the exam where they engaged in academic dishonesty. The grade on that supplemental exam will, at most, replace the original exam grade. If the student fails the supplemental exam, they will receive an F in the course. The decision to offer a supplemental exam is at the instructor\u2019s discretion. In the absence of a supplemental exam, the student will receive a grade of zero on the exam in question. In either case, the student will receive a grade no higher than a C- in the course. If the academic dishonesty is confined to a single examination and the student challenges the finding of academic dishonesty, the case will be referred to OCS with a sanction of an F in the course. If academic dishonesty extends beyond a single exam to an additional exam or homework, the program policy for sanctions is that the student receive an F in the course. If the academic dishonesty is not related to an exam, the sanction will be determined by the instructor. In all cases, students may challenge the findings of academic dishonesty, in which case the disagreement will be resolved by OCS. Course specific policies All policies above apply, specifically for CHEN 3201: If the academic dishonesty is related to a midterm or the final exam, closely proctored supplemental exams will be offered and graded as pass (C-) or fail (F). The student will receive a grade no higher than a C- in the course. If the academic dishonesty is related to the homework, the homework will get a score of 0 and this will count towards the final grade. You are allowed to use the codes from the book or codes that are posted from class, recitation and previous homeworks (you must indicate the origin of the code when you do so). You are not allowed to use codes developed by previous or current students or any codes posted on-line.
