# Hello world

## Matlab
### Installation
You can download Matlab's desktop version from [here](https://wwws.cs.umn.edu/download_software/matlab/). Alternatively you can use Matlab's [live editor](https://matlab.mathworks.com/) directly in your browser.

### Learning to program
There are many resources available to learn Matlab. The [textbook][1] itself provides a self-contained introduction to programming in Matlab in Appendix A. If that is not sufficient, I list here a number of additional resources that you may find useful

- [Matlab Onramp](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/R2020b/portal.html?course=gettingstarted) is Matlab's own video tutorial to get started with Matlab. You need to login with your UMN account (or equivalently the email you used to register for a student account with mathworks).
- Other online resources
  - [Crash course in MATLAB](https://www-users.math.umn.edu/~lerman/math5467/matlab_adv.pdf) by Tobin Driscoll
  - [The official Matlab crash course](https://slccmathdepartment.weebly.com/uploads/2/8/7/2/28720941/matlab_crash_course.pdf) by Adam Attarian
- You can access Matlab's documentation both [online](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/) and from the command window. Simply type `help functionName` or `doc functionName` in the command window to pull up the documentation (if it was not clear you should replace `functionName` with the name of the function that you are interested in, for instance `help fprintf`).

## Gradescope
Gradescope is a great tool for students to hand in their homework with ease and for instructors to grade it. There is a number of guides and tutorials to work with gradescope, I list some of the key ones.

## MATLAB Answers
[MATLAB Answers](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/index) is a great forum to find answers to your programming questions and ask new ones if nobody has aver asked the same question. Parsing MATLAB Answers is one of the best ways of learning. If you have a programming question, you can check if anyone has asked the same or related question on MATLAB Answers. If not please post a question on [Piazza](https://piazza.com/umn/spring2021/chen3201/home).

## Git/GitHub
Git is a version control system that enables the collaborative development/storage of Software. GitHub is the most popular code hosting platform for version control. While you are not allowed to collaborate on your code for this course, you can still use GitHub to store your code, if you wish.
