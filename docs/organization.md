# Course Organization

## Lectures & teaching materials

**Lectures** will be held virtually via [Zoom @Canvas](https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/217014/external_tools/21146). You must be authenticated in Zoom with your `*@umn.edu` account to access the lecture. They will be **recorded** an uploaded to [MediaSpace](https://mediaspace.umn.edu/) on the same day to an unlisted [playlist](https://mediaspace.umn.edu/playlist/edit/1_z9e09674//1).

**Notes** will be uploaded to the [Canvas course page](https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/193402) after lectures.

**Code** examples will be uploaded to the [course GitHub page](https://github.com/smcantab/chen3201-spring2021).

## Books
**Main textbook**:  
_Numerical Methods with Chemical Engineering Applications_ by Kevin D. Dorfman and Prodromos Daoutidis (link to UMN library [entry](https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/217014/external_tools/21146), Amazon [entry](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1107135117/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_tzI.FbWQZJTSB)).

## Homework
- There will be 12 assignments (written and/or code).
- Assignments will be posted by the end of Friday and are **due by the end of Friday (23:59)** of the following week.
- Submit homework through **Gradescope** accessible via the [Canvas course page](https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/217014/external_tools/34925).
- For exercises involving coding I will create a corresponding code assignments. **You must paste your code in the appropriate coding assignment on Gradescope**. Note that Gradescope provides a **code similarity check** so that we can easily spot plagiarism in your code.
- The **worst grade does not count** (see scholastic dishonesty for exceptions), but you cannot skip any assignments (if you do it counts).
- You can be late by 2 days **once**, for whatever reason. Any time after that, late work will not be accepted (score of 0). There can be additional accommodations in the case of properly documented family emergencies or illness.
- I encourage you to collaborate on homework, but **please do so through Piazza** to the extent that is possible. Nevertheless, you must come up with your own solutions and write your own code. So, when answering questions on Piazza guide your classmates towards the solution, do **not** post fully worked solutions.

## Piazza

Please use Piazza ([sign-up link](https://piazza.com/umn/spring2021/chen3201/home)) for anything technical e.g. homework, or anything else that applies broadly to the class. I encourage you to post your questions on Piazza and to try answering your classmates' questions. You can do so anonymously if you do not feel comfortable asking or answering a question publicly.


## Grading Policy

Your grade will be based on these components:  

- **Homework**: 30%
- **Midterm 1**: 20%
- **Midterm 2**: 20%
- **Final Exam**: 30%

## University grading scales

Grade | GPA   | Definitions for undergraduate credit
------|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A     | 4.000 | Represents achievement that significantly exceeds expectations in the course.
B     | 3.000 | Represents achievement that is above the minimum expectations in the course.
C     | 2.000 | Represents achievement that meets the minimum expectations in the course.
D     | 1.000 | Achievement partially meets minimum expectations. Credit is earned but may not fulfill major requirements.
F     | 0.000 | Represents failure in the course and no credit is earned.


## Scholastic dishonesty

### Departmental policy

We understand the pressures students face during the academic semester can be intense, and that the temptation to engage in academic dishonesty can at times be high. However, the department is committed to the highest standards of academic honesty and integrity. To help ensure that our community standards are met, reviews of student academic integrity will take place throughout the semester. If academic dishonesty is uncovered, the following sanctions will be applied. Examples of these reviews involve cross-comparison of student work against other student work, work from prior semesters, or resources available online. If necessary, reviews of student work may continue after the submission of final course grades, and application or removal of sanctions may be imposed retroactively.

Situations where students are found by a preponderance of the evidence to have engaged in academic dishonesty based on the reviews of student work by the course instructor on at least one examination in a course in the chemical engineering program will be addressed by the following program policy:

1.	The instructor will seek to arrange an in-person or virtual meeting with the student to present them with the evidence of the academic dishonesty.
2.	The student will have the opportunity to respond, in accordance with the policy from the Office of Community Standards (OCS).
3.	If following this discussion, the instructor determines that academic dishonesty has not occurred, there will be no report to OCS and no sanctions.
4.	Otherwise, the case will be referred to OCS with the following sanctions in the course:
```
a. If the academic dishonesty is confined to a single examination and the student has admitted fault, the student may be given the option to take an oral examination or closely proctored written examination to demonstrate their understanding of the material on the exam where they engaged in academic dishonesty. The grade on that supplemental exam will, at most, replace the original exam grade. If the student fails the supplemental exam, they will receive an F in the course. The decision to offer a supplemental exam is at the instructorâ€™s discretion. In the absence of a supplemental exam, the student will receive a grade of zero on the exam in question. In either case, the student will receive a grade no higher than a C- in the course.
b. If the academic dishonesty is confined to a single examination and the student challenges the finding of academic dishonesty, the case will be referred to OCS with a sanction of an F in the course.
c. If academic dishonesty extends beyond a single exam to an additional exam or homework, the program policy for sanctions is that the student receive an F in the course.
d. If the academic dishonesty is not related to an exam, the sanction will be determined by the instructor.
```

In all cases, students may challenge the findings of academic dishonesty, in which case the disagreement will be resolved by OCS.

### Course specific policies

All policies above apply, specifically for CHEN 3201:

1. If the academic dishonesty is related to a midterm or the final exam, closely proctored supplemental exams will be offered and graded as pass (C-) or fail (F). The student will receive a grade no higher than a C- in the course.
2. If the academic dishonesty is related to the homework, the homework will get a score of 0 and this will count towards the final grade.
