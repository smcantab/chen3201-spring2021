# About the course

## Overview
This course is meant to be an introduction for undergraduates in Chemical Engineering to basic numerical methods, and appreciation of their potential and limitations, and their application to chemical engineering problem.

Very few problems in chemical engineering have analytical solutions. In the course of learning the engineering science at the heart of chemical engineering, you have probably focused on this small subset of solvable problems. In this class, you will learn how to construct numerical approximations to the solutions of the rest of the problems. The course is organized around the following themes: **(1)** Intro to mathematical modeling and programming in Matlab **(2)** Linear algebraic equations **(3)** Nonlinear algebraic equations **(4)** Numerical integration **(5)** Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) **(6)** Partial Differential Equations (PDEs).

## Communication
**Class discussion**: Please use Piazza ([sign-up link](https://piazza.com/umn/fall2020/chen5595)) for anything technical e.g. homework or general project-related questions, or anything else that applies broadly to the class. I encourage you to post your questions on Piazza and to try answering your classmates' questions. You can do so anonymously if you do not feel comfortable asking or answering a question publicly.

**Assignments**: will be posted on [Canvas course page](https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/193402). See [Homework][2] for details.

**Email**: contact instructor via email from (strictly) your UMN email account for any confidential issues. Please start the subject line with CHEN 5595.

## Pre-requisites

You must be either a MatS/ChEn graduate student or an upper-division MatS/ChEn major who has taken ChEn 3201, MatS 3141. Students from other PhD programs/majors need to receive instructor's approval. You must have a comfortable knowledge of linear algebra and multivariate calculus. Familiarity with probabilities will be helpful but not strictly necessary. You must know at least one programming language, ideally Python. I will assume that you can transition to writing simple programs in Python autonomously (see [Python Resources][1]).
