# About the course

## Overview
This course is meant to be an introduction for undergraduates in Chemical Engineering to basic numerical methods, and appreciation of their potential and limitations, and their application to chemical engineering problem.

Very few problems in chemical engineering have analytical solutions. In the course of learning the engineering science at the heart of chemical engineering, you have probably focused on this small subset of solvable problems. In this class, you will learn how to construct numerical approximations to the solutions of the rest of the problems. The course is organized around the following themes:
1. Intro to mathematical modeling and programming in Matlab
2. Linear algebraic equations
3. Nonlinear algebraic equations
4. Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs): Initial Value Problems and Boundary Value Problems
5. Dynamical Systems Theory
6. Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)
7. Numerical Integration and Interpolation.

## Communication
**Class discussion**: Please use Piazza ([sign-up link]( https://piazza.com/umn/spring2021/chen3201/home)) for anything technical e.g. homework, or anything else that applies broadly to the class. I encourage you to post your questions on Piazza and to try answering your classmates' questions. You can do so anonymously if you do not feel comfortable asking or answering a question publicly.

**Assignments**: will be posted on Gradescope, accessible via the [Canvas course page](https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/217014). See [Homework][2] for details.

**Email**: contact the instructor (Stefano) via email from (strictly) your UMN email account for any confidential issues. Please start the subject line with CHEN 3201. For any other question use Piazza (see above).

## Pre-requisites

You must be either an upper-division ChEn major who has taken ChEn 2001 and ChEn 3005, or have departmental consent to take the class. You must have a comfortable knowledge of linear algebra, multivariate calculus and differential equations. Familiarity with programming will be helpful but not necessary as you will be introduced to the core ideas (see [Matlab Resources][1]).
